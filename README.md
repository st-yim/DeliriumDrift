# Delirium Overview

Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a sudden onset of symptoms, including altered consciousness, cognitive impairment, and fluctuating severity of inattention. Unlike dementia, delirium is distinguished by its acute onset, variable course, and the potential for reversibility through addressing the underlying cause.

## Key Features

- **Acute Onset:** Delirium is marked by a sudden and rapid onset of symptoms.
- **Variable Course:** The severity of symptoms fluctuates over time.
- **Reversibility:** Addressing the causative condition can often reverse delirium.

## Prevalence and Demographics

Delirium is more commonly observed in the elderly population and can serve as the primary manifestation of various serious medical conditions within this age group.
